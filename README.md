## 1. Learn Firewall Concepts
A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules. It acts as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks to prevent unauthorized access.

## 2. Configure Firewall Rules
Firewall rules were configured using UFW to define which network traffic is allowed or denied. Rules were based on port numbers and IP addresses to enforce system security.
